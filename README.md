# Overview

I wanted to introduce myself to TypeScript so this is what I work on. This software implements a Student class in one module and overrides the comparison functionality on the class. In another module, I have the merge sort functionality built into it and I import the class from my first module and create a large list of those objects. I then run the merge sort on the list and print it out in ascending order.

I chose to write this particular program not only to learn a little bit of TypeScript. My end goal in my career is to work on machine learning and data science so I decided to do this particular project to also help familiarize myself more with merge sort.

# Development Environment

I used TypeScript to write this and I did the actual coding in VSCode. I then used node to compile and run the code.

# Future Work

- Implement more sorting methods
- Implement search algorithms
- I think it would be interesting to add functionality to sort alphabetically if people have the same GPA
